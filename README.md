# Sorting Visualizer

## Description

This is a basic sorting visualizer that demonstrates various sorting algorithms in action. Users can select from multiple sorting methods to visualize how each algorithm sorts a randomly generated array of integers. The visual representation are meant to helps in understanding the inner workings of different sorting techniques.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Choose from various algorithms, including:
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
